      <p className="">
        I recently graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a degree
        in Information Engineering & Media. I have a knack for designing, hence
        I enjoy creating human-centric digital experience with my coding skills.
        When I'm not coding, I like to cook meals for my family, or take a walk
        in nature parks.
      </p>
